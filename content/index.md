###About me
![me](%assets_url%/img/me.jpg#me_img)
My name is Jesper Stark Waxell and I am a student at BTH, where I'm studying web programming on a distance since the fall of 2020. My current courses focuses on JavaScript and Web Design.
<br><br>
I am 23 years old and I live in my hometown Uppsala together with my girlfriend, Julia, &amp; my dog, his name is Baloo and he's a young Labrador Retriever.
<br><br>
I also work part time as an accounting assistant for a logistics company located in Upplands Väsby. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, exercising by either going to the gym or running and I spend a fair amount of time watching football, primarly Djurgårdens IF &amp; Arsenal FC which are the teams I support.
